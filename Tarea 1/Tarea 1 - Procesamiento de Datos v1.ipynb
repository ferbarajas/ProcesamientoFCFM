En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad.

There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely.

The potential for this type of vaccine failure has been observed in humans where reanalyses of aP vaccine studies revealed that individuals vaccinated with components of the aP vaccine were protected against disease, but not bacterial colonization** \\[[10]( [11]( This is in addition to the extant, but limited, evidence for natural asymptomatic infection \\[[12](  \n",

In response to Warfel et al., Domenech de CellÃ¨s et al. (2014) \\[[15]( argue that a reduction in incidence among unvaccinated individuals in a population with high aP coverage shows that aP must reduce *B. pertussis* transmission to some extent.

He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the â€œLancetâ€. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to â€œproveâ€ his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but thatâ€™s a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.\n",

My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. Iâ€™d do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury.

If the vaccines arenâ€™t safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy?

When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we arenâ€™t shutting down cities because of an outbreak.\n",

In fact, the delayed administration of the first dose still being effective is totally in line with rapid waning of influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus the patients had a second booster dose which is not normally recommended for adults, further maintaining higher titer levels into the next season. On a cynical reading, one might think that patients sick in May were included even though vaccination began in June. In reality, given the study was conducted for a full calendar year which simply rolled over a month after 'normal peak' season, this means that vaccination began in June of 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) and went through October 1998. \n",

            "What is truth?Â \n",
            "Dr. Oâ€™Shea, in his book: â€œVaccination is Not Immunizationâ€ explains:Â  â€œDo not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you donâ€™t know what herd immunity is, youâ€™ll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Donâ€™t be fooled againâ€\n",
            "Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: â€œThis whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.\"\"\n",
            "In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what weâ€™re taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.\n",
            "Thus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year.\n",
            "The entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.\n",
            "By failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines.\n",
            "So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right?\n",
            "Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains:Â \n",
            "â€œIn the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity.Â But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short periodâ€¦\n",
            "This is why they quietly began to suggest Â boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.\n",
            "Then they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.\n",
            "That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given.\n",
            "What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades.\n",
            "If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection.\n",
            "Herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinationsâ€.\n",

            "Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well:\n",
            "Do children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because theyâ€™ve been vaccinated? NO\n",
            "Do pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NO\n",
            "Do pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates.\n",
            "Do unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because theyâ€™ve been vaccinated? NO\n",
            "Do unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria.\n",
            "Anyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate.

            ">The occurrence of encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis vaccination has been an issue of intense scrutiny and debate. Often cited are the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study conducted in UK from 1976 to 1979 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (1994). The initial findings of the National Encephalopathy study were that acute encephalopathy occurred at a rate of 1 per 310,000 to 5,300,000 doses (95% CI 54,000 to 5,310,000). Subsequent investigations and follow-up of the affected children then cast some doubt on these initial findings and demonstrated no increase in the rate of death or other sequelae after a DTwP vaccine (Edwards et al., 2008). However, despite these revised findings this has been an area of ongoing controversy. In 1994, the IOM concluded that â€œthe balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DTwP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children whose serious acute neurological illness occurred within 7 days of a DTwP vaccinationâ€. This may imply that the vaccine rarely may trigger such an event in an individual who may be predisposed to develop such a condition because of an underlying abnormality. The IOM committee concluded that the evidence is insufficient to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between DTwP vaccine and permanent neurological damage (Cowan et al.,1993). More recent studies do not confirm an association between DTwP and acute encephalopathy. A population-based case-control study has evaluated the association between serious acute neurological illness and receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, given as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. The estimated odds ratio for children with encephalopathy or complicated seizures was 3.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.2). The study concluded that there was no statistically significant increased risk of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTwP vaccine exposure (Gale et al., 1994). A retrospective case-control study performed at four health maintenance organizations by examining children aged 0 to 6 years who were hospitalized with encephalopathy or related conditions determined that cases were no more likely than controls to have received a DTwP vaccine during the 90 days before disease onset. When encephalopathy of known etiology was excluded, the odds ratio for case children having received DTP within 7 days before onset of disease was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.45-3.31, P = 0.693) compared with control children. The study concluded that DTwP vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy (Ray et al., 2006).\"\n",
